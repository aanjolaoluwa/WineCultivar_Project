# Wine Cultivar Origin Prediction System 🍷

This project is a machine learning system that predicts the origin (cultivar) of wine based on its chemical properties using the UCI Wine Dataset.

## Features Used
The following 10 chemical features were used:
- Alcohol  
- Malic Acid  
- Ash  
- Alcalinity of Ash  
- Magnesium  
- Total Phenols  
- Flavanoids  
- Color Intensity  
- Hue  
- Proline  

## Machine Learning Algorithm
Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Dataset
UCI / sklearn Wine Dataset  
- 178 samples  
- 13 total features  
- 3 wine cultivars
